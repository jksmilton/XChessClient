/****************************************************************************
 * jcPlayer.java - An abstract base class for all types of players
 * by François Dominic Laramée
 *
 * Purpose: There are currently two types of players in JavaChess: the computer
 * player and the human player.  At a later time, other types may be added,
 * including the demo player (which picks its moves from a file, in which a
 * game has been recorded move by move) and a network player (an entity from
 * which the game obtains moves via a socket connection).

 * History:
 * 08.06.00 Created
